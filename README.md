# Co2-Emssions-in-7-Years
Analyzing Co2 Emissions in 7 years for Candian Vehicles
This project is a part of Data Camp competion https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/45cbefc7-7ae3-48b9-ae11-b4c095a144e5/edit
## Project intro :
### Answering Questions about The Co2 Emissions of Cars in 7 Years
#### ðŸ’ª Challenge I
Help your colleague gain insights on the type of vehicles that have lower CO2 emissions. Include:

1. What is the median engine size in liters?
2. What is the average fuel consumption for regular gasoline (Fuel Type = X), premium gasoline (Z), ethanol (E), and diesel (D)?  
3. What is the correlation between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions?
4. Which vehicle class has lower average CO2 emissions, 'SUV - SMALL' or 'MID-SIZE'? 
5. What are the average CO2 emissions for all vehicles? For vehicles with an engine size of 2.0 liters or smaller?
6. Any other insights you found during your analysis?
## ðŸ’¾ The data 

### I have access to seven years of CO2 emissions data for Canadian vehicles ([source](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64#wb-auto-6)):

- "Make" - The company that manufactures the vehicle.
- "Model" - The vehicle's model.
- "Vehicle Class" - Vehicle class by utility, capacity, and weight.
- "Engine Size(L)" - The engine's displacement in liters.
- "Cylinders" - The number of cylinders.
- "Transmission" - The transmission type: A = Automatic, AM = Automatic Manual, AS = Automatic with select shift, AV = Continuously variable, M = Manual, 3 - 10 = the number of gears.
- "Fuel Type" - The fuel type: X = Regular gasoline, Z = Premium gasoline, D = Diesel, E = Ethanol (E85), N = natural gas.
- "Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)" - Combined city/highway (55%/45%) fuel consumption in liters per 100 km (L/100 km).
- "CO2 Emissions(g/km)" - The tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions in grams per kilometer for combined city and highway driving. 

The data comes from the Government of Canada's open data [website](https://open.canada.ca/en).
